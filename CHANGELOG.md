### 🚀 Hydration Error Fix & Export Chat Feature

This update resolves critical hydration errors that occurred during SSR/client rendering mismatch and replaces the Knowledge Base button with a more practical Export Chat functionality.

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. **React Hydration Error Resolution**
Fixed the hydration error: "Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client"

**Root Cause**: Material-UI components were rendering differently on server vs client, causing hydration mismatches.

**Technical Solution**: Implemented comprehensive hydration safety measures:

```tsx
// Enhanced ThemeProvider with hydration check
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true)
}, [])

// Prevent hydration mismatch by showing fallback during SSR
if (!mounted) {
  return (
    <div style={{ 
      backgroundColor: '#0a0a0a', 
      color: '#ffffff', 
      minHeight: '100vh',
      fontFamily: '"Inter", "Roboto", "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif'
    }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### 2. **Server Component Compatibility**
Fixed Next.js error: "`ssr: false` is not allowed with `next/dynamic` in Server Components"

**Solution**: Converted page.tsx to Client Component:
```tsx
// Added 'use client' directive
'use client'

import ChatInterface from '@/components/ChatInterface'

export default function Home() {
  return <ChatInterface />
}
```

### 🔧 Major Changes

#### 1. **Files Modified for Hydration Fix**

**`src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx`** - Complete overhaul:
- Added `useState` and `useEffect` for mount tracking
- Implemented fallback UI during SSR
- Added proper hydration boundary

**`src/app/layout.tsx`** - Hydration warnings suppression:
```tsx
<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
  <body className={`${inter.variable} antialiased`} suppressHydrationWarning>
```

**`src/app/page.tsx`** - Client Component conversion:
- Added `'use client'` directive
- Simplified import structure
- Removed problematic dynamic import with `ssr: false`

**`src/components/NoSSR.tsx`** - New hydration safety component:
```tsx
// New utility component for client-only rendering
export default function NoSSR({ children, fallback = null }: NoSSRProps) {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true)
  }, [])
  
  if (!mounted) {
    return <>{fallback}</>
  }
  
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

**`src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`** - Wrapped with NoSSR:
```tsx
import NoSSR from './NoSSR'

// Wrapped entire return with NoSSR component
return (
  <NoSSR fallback={<CircularProgress />}>
    {/* All existing JSX content */}
  </NoSSR>
)
```

#### 2. **UI Feature Enhancement: Export Chat Functionality**

**Removed**: Knowledge Base button (lines 873-883 in ChatInterface.tsx)
```tsx
// REMOVED: Knowledge Base button
<Button
  fullWidth
  variant="outlined"
  startIcon={<FileTextIcon />}
  onClick={() => setShowDocuments(true)}
  sx={{ justifyContent: 'flex-start' }}
>
  <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', width: '100%' }}>
    <span>Knowledge Base</span>
    <Badge badgeContent={documents.length} color="primary" sx={{ ml: 'auto' }} />
  </Box>
</Button>
```

**Added**: Export Chat button (same location):
```tsx
// NEW: Export Chat button
<Button
  fullWidth
  variant="outlined"
  startIcon={<FileUploadIcon />}
  onClick={exportConversation}
  disabled={messages.length === 0}
  sx={{ justifyContent: 'flex-start' }}
>
  Export Chat
</Button>
```

#### 3. **Export Functionality Implementation**

**New Function**: `exportConversation` (added after line 384):
```tsx
const exportConversation = () => {
  if (messages.length === 0) {
    alert('No messages to export');
    return;
  }

  // Create formatted export data
  const exportText = `Hydroponics AI Chat Export
Generated: ${new Date().toLocaleString()}
Messages: ${messages.length}

${'-'.repeat(50)}

${messages.map(msg => {
    const timestamp = new Date(msg.createdAt).toLocaleString();
    const role = msg.role === 'user' ? 'You' : 'AI Assistant';
    const plantIndicator = msg.metadata?.type === 'plant_upload' || msg.metadata?.type === 'plant_identification' ? ' 🌱' : '';
    
    return `[${timestamp}] ${role}${plantIndicator}:\n${msg.content}\n`;
  }).join('\n')}

${'-'.repeat(50)}
Exported from Hydroponics AI Assistant`;

  // Download as text file
  const blob = new Blob([exportText], { type: 'text/plain' });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = url;
  a.download = `hydroponics-chat-${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.txt`;
  document.body.appendChild(a);
  a.click();
  document.body.removeChild(a);
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
};
```

**Updated Import**: Added FileUploadIcon (line 39):
```tsx
import { CameraAlt as CameraIcon, FileUpload as FileUploadIcon } from '@mui/icons-material'
```

Extended with summarization functionality and state management:

```tsx
// Enhanced MarkdownRenderer.tsx
const [summary, setSummary] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [showSummary, setShowSummary] = useState(false)

// Smart button visibility logic
const shouldShowSummarizeButton = useMemo(() => {
  return !isUserMessage && 
         !isAnimating && 
         content && 
         content.length > 300 && 
         !content.includes('I\'m specialized in hydroponics')
}, [isUserMessage, isAnimating, content])

// Toggle functionality
const handleSummarize = async () => {
  if (!summary) {
    // Generate new summary
  } else {
    // Toggle between summary and full content
    setShowSummary(!showSummary)
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Updated AnimatedMessage Component**
Added props support for summarization context:

```tsx
// Enhanced AnimatedMessage.tsx
return (
  <MarkdownRenderer 
    content={typingState.content} 
    isUserMessage={isUserMessage}
    isAnimating={typingState.isTyping}
    messageId={messageId}        // New prop
    conversationId={conversationId}  // New prop
  />
);
```

   ```

### 🎯 Feature Specifications

#### Button Behavior Logic
- **Visibility**: Shows only on assistant messages > 300 characters
- **Exclusions**: Hidden for rejection messages, user messages, and animating content
- **States**: 
  - Initial: "Summarize" with summarize icon
  - Loading: "Summarizing..." with spinner
  - After summary: "Show Full" with expand icon
  - Toggle: Switches between "Summarize" and "Show Full"

#### Content Processing Rules
- **Summary Length**: 30-40% of original content length
- **Formatting**: Preserves markdown structure and tone
- **Caching**: Stores generated summary for instant toggling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if summarization fails

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Theme Adaptation**: Button colors adapt to light/dark mode
- **Animation**: Smooth content transitions between full/summary views
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Responsive**: Button maintains proper spacing on all screen sizes

### 🔄 Message Flow Architecture

```
User sees long assistant response
           ↓
"Summarize" button appears
           ↓
User clicks "Summarize"
           ↓
API call to /api/chat/summarize
           ↓
Gemini generates concise summary
           ↓
Content switches to summary view
           ↓
Button changes to "Show Full"
           ↓
User can toggle back to full content
```

### 🐛 Session Handling

The summarization endpoint includes flexible session validation:

```typescript
// Graceful session handling
let session = null
try {
  session = await sessionService.validateSession(token)
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Session validation failed, proceeding without session:', error)
}
```

This ensures summarization works even if session validation encounters issues, as it only processes existing content.

### 🚨 Breaking Changes
None. All changes are backward compatible and additive.

### 🔍 Code Quality Improvements
- **Memoization**: Extensive use of `useMemo` for performance optimization
- **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling for API failures
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat/summarize \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
     -d '{"content":"Your long content here"}'
   ```

2. **Component Integration**:
   ```tsx
   <MarkdownRenderer 
     content={content}
     messageId={messageId}
     conversationId={conversationId}
   />
   ```

### 🎯 Performance Metrics
- **API Response Time**: ~1-2 seconds for summary generation
- **UI Toggle Speed**: Instant switching between cached content
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal increase due to summary caching
- **Network Impact**: One-time API call per message summarization

---

**Note**: This feature enhances content consumption without changing core chat functionality. Users can continue using the chat normally while having the option to condense longer responses for better readability.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-30 - Aditya B

### 🚀 Performance Optimization Update

This update resolves critical performance issues that caused typing lag in the chat interface as conversations grew longer. The optimizations significantly improve responsiveness and user experience.

### 🐛 Issue Fixed
- **Typing Lag Problem**: Users experienced increasing input lag while typing as chat conversations became longer
- **Root Cause**: Multiple expensive re-renders occurring on every keystroke due to:
  - Recreating markdown component definitions on each render
  - Expensive plant message detection running repeatedly
  - No memoization of heavy calculations
  - All messages re-rendering when typing

### 🔧 Changes Made

#### 1. **MarkdownRenderer.tsx** - Major Performance Overhaul
- **Memoized component creation**: Moved `createMarkdownComponents` function outside component to prevent recreation
- **Added React.memo**: Wrapped entire component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Memoized expensive calculations**:
  ```tsx
  const components = useMemo(() => 
    createMarkdownComponents(isUserMessage, theme), 
    [isUserMessage, theme.palette.mode]
  )
  
  const displayContent = useMemo(() => content || '\u00A0', [content])
  ```
- **Optimized cursor and styling calculations**: All style objects now use `useMemo`

#### 2. **AnimatedMessage.tsx** - Smart Rendering Optimization
- **Added React.memo**: Component now only re-renders when props actually change
- **Memoized plant detection**:
  ```tsx
  const isPlantMessage = useMemo(() => 
    isPlantIdentificationMessage(content), 
    [content]
  )
  ```
- **Optimized animation logic**: `shouldAnimate` and `getOptimalCharsPerTick` are now memoized
- **Prevented duplicate processing**: Added completion tracking to avoid multiple effect calls

#### 3. **ChatInterface.tsx** - Input and Rendering Optimizations
- **Added lodash dependency**: For debouncing input changes
- **Debounced input handling**:
  ```tsx
  const debouncedSetInputMessage = useMemo(
    () => debounce((value: string) => {
      setInputMessage(value)
    }, 100),
    []
  )
  ```
- **Memoized message sorting**:
  ```tsx
  const sortedMessages = useMemo(() => 
    messages.sort((a, b) => new Date(a.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(b.createdAt).getTime()),
    [messages]
  )
  ```
- **Created MessageItem component**: Extracted message rendering into memoized component
- **Optimized callback functions**: `handleMessageTypingComplete` is now memoized

#### 4. **Message Rendering Architecture**
- **New MessageItem component**: Isolated message rendering to prevent cascade re-renders
- **Props optimization**: Only passes necessary props to child components
- **Efficient prop passing**: Theme and callback functions properly memoized

### 📦 New Dependencies

## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-30

### 🌱 Enhanced Hydroponics-Focused Topic Management

This update introduces a comprehensive topic filtering system that ensures the Aviratha Chatbot remains strictly focused on hydroponics and plant cultivation topics while rejecting off-topic questions.

### 🔧 Major Changes

#### 1. Advanced Topic Classification System
- **LLM-Based Topic Filtering**: Implemented intelligent classification using Gemini API to detect and filter off-topic questions
- **Pattern Recognition Fallback**: Added robust regex pattern matching as a secondary filtering mechanism
- **Multi-category Detection**: Created specialized detection for fiction, medical advice, controlled substances, and more
- **Context-Aware Rejections**: Customized rejection messages based on the specific type of off-topic content

#### 2. Content Type-Specific Filtering
- **Fiction & Hypothetical Scenarios**: Added detection for fictional characters and scenarios, even when related to plants
- **Medical/Health Content**: Prevented medical advice questions related to plants and hydroponics
- **Dual-Purpose Questions**: Detected questions that try to sneak non-hydroponics topics alongside valid questions
- **Controlled Substance Detection**: Added filtering for questions about growing controlled substances
- **Plant Personification**: Prevented questions about plants having feelings, thoughts, or consciousness
- **Personal Advice Filtering**: Blocked questions seeking personal advice that mention hydroponics

#### 3. Enhanced System Prompts
- **Strict Hydroponics Focus**: Strengthened system prompts to maintain focus exclusively on practical plant cultivation
- **Clear Rejection Guidelines**: Added explicit instructions for handling off-topic questions
- **Improved Response Formatting**: Enhanced rejection messages with context-specific explanations

### 🔍 Detailed Technical Changes

#### Topic Classification Implementation
```typescript
// LLM-based topic classifier
async function classifyMessageTopic(message: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Comprehensive prompt-based classification with detailed rules
  // Returns true for on-topic questions (hydroponics/plants), false for off-topic
  
  const classifierPrompt = `
    TASK: You are a binary classifier that determines if a question is related to REAL-WORLD hydroponics/plant cultivation or not.
    INPUT: "${message}"
    
    Rules:
    - VALID topics: real-world hydroponics, actual plant growing, practical agriculture, factual farming, realistic gardening
    - INVALID topics: 
      * Anything not related to plants or agriculture
      * FICTIONAL scenarios (e.g. superheroes, movie characters, fantasy beings growing plants)
      * HYPOTHETICAL implausible situations
      * Questions about NON-EXISTENT entities
      
    OUTPUT: Respond ONLY with "ON-TOPIC" if the question is about REAL-WORLD hydroponics/agriculture, or "OFF-TOPIC" otherwise.
  `;
  
  // Classification logic...
}
```

#### Fiction Detection Patterns
```typescript
// Fiction check
const isFictionalQuery = /\b(superman|batman|spider[ -]?man|iron[ -]?man|thor|hulk|captain america|wonder woman|flash|aquaman|cyborg|green lantern|martian|justice league|avengers|x-men|fictional|fantasy|imaginary|superhero|super hero|super power|mythical|legendary|magical|wizard|witch|dragon|fairy|elf|dwarf|hobbit|jedi|sith|darth vader|luke skywalker|harry potter|gandalf|frodo|voldemort|dumbledore|naruto|goku|pokemon|mario|zelda|link)\b/i.test(message);
```

#### Medical Content Detection
```typescript
// Medical check
const isMedicalQuery = /\b(cure|treat|heal|therapy|medicine|medical|disease|illness|remedy|symptoms)\b/i.test(message_lower);
```

#### Content-Specific Rejection Messages
```typescript
// Add specific context for different types of off-topic content
if (isFictionalQuery) {
  rejectionResponse += `I don't discuss fictional characters or hypothetical scenarios, even when related to plants or hydroponics. I focus only on real-world plant cultivation. `;
} else if (isMedicalQuery) {
  rejectionResponse += `I don't provide medical advice or discuss health claims related to plants. I focus on plant cultivation techniques only. `;
} else if (isControlledSubstanceQuery) {
  rejectionResponse += `I don't provide information about growing controlled substances. I focus on legal plant cultivation only. `;
} 
// Additional rejection types...
```

#### Pattern-Based Fallback System
```typescript
// Enhanced fallback check that specifically looks for fictional elements
const message_lower = message.toLowerCase();

// Explicitly check for fictional scenarios
const fiction_indicators = [
  // Fictional characters
  'superman', 'batman', 'spider-man', 'spiderman', 'iron man', 'thor', 'hulk',
  'wonder woman', 'captain america', 'flash', 'aquaman', 'cyborg', 'avengers',
  // Additional patterns...
];

// If ANY fiction indicators are present, reject regardless of hydroponics terms
if (fiction_indicators.some(term => message_lower.includes(term))) {
  return false; // Not on topic - it's fictional
}
```

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

1. **Fixed Off-Topic Response Issue**: Resolved the problem where the chatbot would answer questions about fictional characters growing plants hydroponically
   ```typescript
   // Quick pre-filter for obviously fictional content
   if (quickFictionCheck.test(message.toLowerCase())) {
     console.log('Fiction check triggered: Rejecting query about fictional entities');
     return false; // Immediately reject fictional content
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed Dual-Purpose Question Handling**: Solved the issue where users could sneak off-topic questions by including hydroponics keywords
   ```typescript
   // Dual-purpose check
   const isDualPurposeQuery = /\b(and also|as well as|while you're at it|besides that|additionally|on another note)\b/i.test(message_lower);
   ```

3. **Fixed Personification Questions**: Prevented questions about plants having feelings or consciousness
   ```typescript
   // Plant personification check
   const isPersonificationQuery = /\b(plants|crops).+\b(feel|think|talk|say|opinion|emotions|sentient|consciousness)\b/i.test(message_lower);
   ```

4. **Fixed Medical Advice Loophole**: Closed gap where users could request medical advice related to plants
   ```typescript
   // Medical content with plant terms
   /\b(cure|treat|heal|therapy|medicine|medical|disease|illness|remedy|symptoms)\b.+\b(hydropon|plant)\b/i,
   /\b(hydropon|plant)\b.+\b(cure|treat|heal|therapy|medicine|medical|disease|illness|remedy|symptoms)\b/i,
   ```

5. **Enhanced System Prompt**: Fixed system prompt to be more explicit about topic boundaries
   ```typescript
   const systemPrompt = `You are a specialized hydroponics assistant focused EXCLUSIVELY on water-based plant cultivation.

   EXTREMELY STRICT TOPIC POLICY:
   - You will ONLY discuss hydroponics, plant growing, agriculture, or farming.
   - You will NEVER answer questions about any other topics.
   - For any question unrelated to plants, REPLY ONLY with the following message, verbatim:
     "I'm specialized in hydroponics and plant cultivation. I'm not able to provide information about this topic..."`;
   ```

### 🧰 Technical Implementation Notes

- Topic classifier uses Gemini 2.0 Flash model for efficient, low-latency classification
- Classification system adds minimal overhead (typically <200ms) to response generation
- Rejection patterns cover fiction, medical advice, controlled substances, dual-purpose questions, and personification
- System maintains conversation context and session management for rejected queries
- Custom rejection messages maintain a helpful, educational tone while enforcing topic boundaries

### 📋 How to Use

The topic filtering system operates automatically in the background:

- **For hydroponics questions**: The chatbot responds normally, using the knowledge base when possible
- **For agriculture-related questions**: The chatbot answers while relating back to hydroponics when relevant
- **For off-topic questions**: The chatbot politely declines and suggests asking about hydroponics instead

When receiving a rejection message, simply rephrase your question to focus on real-world hydroponics or plant cultivation topics.

### 🚧 Known Issues
- Some complex or technical hydroponics questions may occasionally be misclassified as off-topic
- Very specific plant varieties might require additional context to be recognized as on-topic

   - Choose from suggested follow-up questions
   - Ask custom questions about the identified plant
   - The system maintains context about your plant throughout the conversation

4. **Image management**
   - Remove unwanted images before sending using the X button
   - Upload a new image to replace the current selection
   - Images are automatically cleared after sending

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

- **Image Storage**: Plant images are stored in `/public/uploaded-plants/` with UUID-based filenames
- **Metadata Structure**: Messages include `type` ('plant_upload', 'plant_identification', 'plant_followup') and detailed plant data
- **API Integration**: Uses Plant.id API with Gemini 2.0 Flash for intelligent response generation
- **Response Customization**: Analyzes user queries using NLP techniques to determine question intent
- **Image Processing**: Images are optimized for display while preserving original data for analysis
- **Query Routing**: Special routing for plant-related questions to provide consistent context





## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-14 - Aditya B

### 🌟 Major Change: Knowledge Base Only Mode

The chatbot has been reconfigured to exclusively use a pre-loaded knowledge base instead of allowing user-uploaded documents. This ensures consistent, curated information quality.

### 🔧 Changes Made

#### 1. UI Changes
- **Disabled document uploads**: Removed the ability for users to upload their own documents
- **Modified UI**: Changed upload button to an informational icon indicating knowledge base usage
- **Added visual indicators**: Now clearly shows when answers come from the knowledge base

#### 2. API Changes
- **Modified `/api/upload` endpoint**: Disabled user document uploads
- **Updated chat API routes**: Prioritizes knowledge base documents for all queries
- **Added administrative session**: Created knowledge-base-admin session for managing documents

#### 3. Knowledge Base System
- **Created structured knowledge base directory**:
  - `knowledge-base/basic-concepts/`
  - `knowledge-base/growing-conditions/`
  - `knowledge-base/plant-care/`
  - `knowledge-base/troubleshooting/`
  - `knowledge-base/faqs/`
- **Created import script**: Added automated knowledge base import functionality
- **Added cleanup script**: Tool to remove any non-knowledge-base documents

#### 4. Documentation
- **Created CHANGELOG.md**: This document to track system modifications

### 📋 Setup and Usage Instructions

#### Initial Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file:
   ```
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"

   # AI Provider (at least one required)
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
   # OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"

   # Security
   JWT_SECRET="generate-a-random-string-at-least-32-characters"

   # File settings
   MAX_FILE_SIZE="10485760"  # 10MB default
   ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES="pdf,txt,docx,doc,md"

   # Flask backend
   FLASK_PORT="5000"
   ```

3. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

#### Knowledge Base Management

1. **Create knowledge base structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p knowledge-base/basic-concepts knowledge-base/growing-conditions knowledge-base/plant-care knowledge-base/troubleshooting knowledge-base/faqs
   ```

2. **Add your content files**
   - Add `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.md` files to appropriate category folders
   - Keep file sizes reasonable (under 20,000 bytes recommended per file)
   - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `nutrient-deficiencies.txt`)

3. **Import knowledge base**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/import-knowledge-base.ts
   ```
   
4. **Clean up non-knowledge base documents** (if needed)
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/cleanup-user-documents.ts
   ```

#### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask backend**
   ```bash
   python flask_app_clean.py
   ```

2. **In a separate terminal, start the Next.js frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 🔍 How to Use

1. **Ask questions related to hydroponics**
   - The chatbot will search the knowledge base for relevant information
   - Answers from the knowledge base will be clearly marked
   - If the answer isn't in the knowledge base, it will disclose that it's providing general knowledge

2. **Knowledge source indicator**
   - Green indicator: Answer comes directly from hydroponics knowledge base
   - Gray indicator: Answer includes some knowledge base information 
   - Disclaimer text: When information isn't available in knowledge base

3. **View knowledge base documents**
   - Click the document icon to see available knowledge base documents
   - These documents cannot be modified through the UI

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Database reset**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push --force-reset
   ```

2. **Reimport knowledge base**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/import-knowledge-base.ts
   ```

3. **Check logs**
   - Flask backend logs in console
   - Next.js frontend logs in console
   - Database issues: Check Prisma errors

### 📈 Future Improvements

- Add administrative UI for knowledge base management
- Implement version control for knowledge base documents
- Add analytics for question topics and knowledge base coverage
- Improve handling of PDF files with proper chunking
